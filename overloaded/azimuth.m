function az = azimuth(varargin)
%AZIMUTH  Azimuth between points on sphere or ellipsoid
%
%   AZ = AZIMUTH(LAT1,LON1,LAT2,LON2) computes the great circle bearing AZ,
%   the azimuth from point 1 to point 2, for pairs of points on the surface
%   of a sphere.  The input latitudes and longitudes, LAT1, LON1, LAT2,
%   LON2, can be scalars or arrays of matching size.  Azimuths are
%   expressed in degrees clockwise from north, ranging from 0 to 360.  When
%   given a combination of scalar and array inputs, the scalar inputs are
%   automatically expanded to match the size of the arrays.
%
%   AZ = AZIMUTH(LAT1,LON1,LAT2,LON2,ELLIPSOID) computes the azimuth(s)
%   assuming that the points lie on the ellipsoid defined by the input
%   ELLIPSOID.  ELLIPSOID is a reference ellipsoid (oblate spheroid)
%   object, a reference sphere object, or a vector of the form
%   [semimajor_axis, eccentricity].
%
%   AZ = AZIMUTH(LAT1,LON1,LAT2,LON2,UNITS) uses the input UNITS to define
%   the angle units used for AZ and the latitude-longitude coordinates.
%   UNITS may equal 'degrees' (the default value) or 'radians'.  Azimuths
%   range from 0 to 2*pi when 'radians' are specified.
%
%   AZ = AZIMUTH(LAT1,LON1,LAT2,LON2,ELLIPSOID,UNITS) specify both an
%   ellipsoid vector and the units of AZ and the latitude-longitude
%   coordinates. 
%   
%   AZ = AZIMUTH(TRACK,...) uses the input TRACK to specify either a great
%   circle/geodesic or a rhumb line azimuth calculation.  If TRACK equals
%   'gc' (the default value), then great circle azimuths are computed on a
%   sphere and geodesic azimuths are computed on an ellipsoid. If TRACK
%   equals 'rh', then rhumb line azimuths are computed on either a sphere
%   or ellipsoid.
%
%   AZ = AZIMUTH(PT1,PT2) accepts N-by-2 coordinate arrays PT1 and PT2
%   such that PT1 = [LAT1 LON1] and PT2 = [LAT2 LON2] where LAT1, LON1,
%   LAT2, and LON2 are column vectors.  It is equivalent to
%   AZ = AZIMUTH(PT1(:,1),PT1(:,2),PT2(:,1),PT2(:,2)).
%
%   AZ = AZIMUTH(PT1,PT2,ELLIPSOID)
%   AZ = AZIMUTH(PT1,PT2,UNITS),
%   AZ = AZIMUTH(PT1,PT2,ELLIPSOID,UNITS) and
%   AZ = AZIMUTH(TRACK,PT1,...) are all valid calling forms.
%
%   Remark on Eccentricity
%   ----------------------
%   Geodesic azimuths on an ellipsoid are valid only for small
%   eccentricities typical of the Earth (e.g., 0.08 or less).
%
%   Remark on Long Geodesics
%   ------------------------
%   Azimuth calculations for geodesics degrade slowly with increasing
%   distance and may break down for points that are nearly antipodal,
%   and/or when both points are very close to the Equator.  In addition,
%   for calculations on an ellipsoid, there is a small but finite input
%   space, consisting of pairs in which both the points are nearly
%   antipodal AND both points fall close to (but not precisely on) the
%   Equator. In this case, a warning is issued and AZ is set to NaN for
%   the "problem pairs."
