function [lat, lon] = polymerge(lat, lon, tol, outputformat)
%POLYMERGE Merge line segments with matching endpoints
%
%   [latMerged, lonMerged] = POLYMERGE(LAT, LON) accepts a multipart line
%   in latitude-longitude with vertices stored in arrays LAT and LON, and
%   merges the parts wherever a pair of end points coincide. For this
%   purpose, an end point can be either the first or last vertex in a given
%   part. When a pair of parts are merged, they are combined into a single
%   part and the duplicate common vertex is removed.  If two first vertices
%   coincide or two last vertices coincide, then the vertex order of one of
%   the parts will be reversed.  A merge is applied anywhere that the end
%   points of exactly two distinct parts coincide, so that an indefinite
%   number of parts can be chained together in a single call to POLYMERGE.
%   If three or more distinct parts share a common end point, however, the
%   choice of which parts to merge is ambiguous and therefore none of the
%   corresponding parts are connected at that common point.
%
%   The inputs LAT and LON can be column or row vectors with NaN-separated
%   parts (and identical NaN locations in each array), or they can be cell
%   arrays with each part in a separate cell. The form of the output
%   arrays, latMerged and lonMerged, matches the inputs in this regard.
%
%   [latMerged, lonMerged] = POLYMERGE(LAT, LON, TOL) combines line
%   segments whose endpoints are separated by less than the circular
%   tolerance TOL. TOL has the same units as the polygon input.
%
%   [latMerged, lonMerged] = POLYMERGE(LAT, LON, TOL, outputFormat) allows
%   you to request either the NaN-separated vector form for the output (set
%   outputFormat to 'vector'), or the cell array form (set outputFormat to
%   'cell').

function [c1Merged, c2Merged] ...
    = mergeMultipart(c1, c2, distanceFcn, midpointFcn, tol)
% Merge a multipart line. Inputs c1 and c2 are NaN-delimited (and
% terminated) column vectors.  Input distanceFcn is a handle to a function
% that computes an array of distances given two pairs of coordinate arrays.
% Input midPointFcn is a handle to a function that computes the point
% halfway between a pair of points. Input TOL is the maximum distance at
% which two points are considered to be coincident.

% The first step is to determine the indices in the vertex arrays c1 and c2
% that correspond to the starting points ("first") and ending points
% ("last") of each part. From there, we compute a "connection" vector with
% two elements per part.

[first, last, connection] = identifyConnections(c1, c2, distanceFcn, tol);

% Before tracing through the connections, bring pairs of vertices that are
% separated by less than TOL into perfect coincidence by replacing each

if tol > 0
    % Note: The adjustment process here and the loop below, in which the
    % full set of vertex coordinates are copied to the output, both involve
    % tracing through the connection vector.  Beyond that similarity,
    % however, the two processes are very different.  Here we make sure to
    % adjust each end point that is part of a pair to be merged -- so we
    % "visit" all of the non-zero elements of connection.  Later we visit
    % each of the "free" end points, which are indicated by values of 0 in
    % the connection vector.  The paths through the connection vector will
    % be very different in these two cases.  This is one reason why it
    % works well to perform the adjustments via a pre-processing step.
    [c1, c2] = adjustCoincidentVertices( ...
        c1, c2, first, last, connection, midpointFcn);
end

% Excluding identities, loops (parts that start and end in the same place),
% and junctions at which more than two ending or starting points coincide,
% each element of the connection vector corresponds to either the starting
% point or ending point of one of the parts, arranged in the following
% order:
%
%                   [start1 end1 start2 end2 ...]
%
% If one part connects to another part (with a pair-wise coincidence of
% starting/ending vertices), then the element corresponding to the first
% part will contain the index of the element corresponding to the second
% part. On the other hand, if a starting or ending point does not coincide
% with the starting or ending point of another part, then value of its
% "connection" element will be 0.  Thus, the essential step in merging the
% input parts is to trace these self-references through the connection
% vector, starting at a zero-valued element, and finishing up and starting
% over with another new output part whenever another 0 is encountered.
%
% For example, if the value of the k-th element of the connections vector
% is 7 and k happens to be even, this means that the ending point of the
% p-th part (where p = k / 2) coincides with the starting point of the 4-th
% part (because 4 == (7 + 1) / 2).  Connections like this can be traced
% from one part to another.  Continuing with this example, we can move on
% to the ending point 4-th part by looking the 8-th element of the
% connection vector (because 8 == 7 + 1 = 2*4 - 1).  Suppose its value is
% 12; this means that it coincides with the end point of the 6-th part.
% Arriving at an ending point (as opposed to a starting point) simply means
% that we have to reverse the vertices during the merge.  So in this
% example we move forward as we copy the vertices from 4-th part to the
% output, but then copy the 6-th part in reverse order. To see where to go
% from starting point of the 6-th part, we look at the 11-th element (11 =
% 2*6 - 1 = 12 - 1) of the connection vector.  Suppose that there is no
% starting or ending vertex that coincides with this point; in this case,
% the 11-th element of connections will contain value 0.
%
% In some cases, one or more input part will stand apart and not need to be
% merged with any other part. If this is the case for the 10th part, for
% example, then elements 19 and 20 of the connection vector will contain 0.

% Initialize the output vertex arrays, filling them with NaN. The size of
% the inputs provides a safe upper bound on the size of the outputs,
% because there is no way for the number of elements to increase during the
% merge process: each part-to-part connection results in the loss of one
% NaN-separator and one set of vertex coordinates.
