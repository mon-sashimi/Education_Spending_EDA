function [mapout,lat,lon] = neworig(map,R,origin,direction,units)
%NEWORIG Orient regular data grid to oblique aspect
%
%   [Z,lat,lon] = NEWORIG(Z0,R,origin) and
%   [Z,lat,lon] = NEWORIG(Z0,R,origin,'forward') will transform regular
%   data grid Z0 into an oblique aspect, while preserving the matrix
%   storage format.  In other words, the oblique map origin is not
%   necessarily at (0,0) in the Greenwich coordinate frame. This allows
%   operations to be performed on the matrix representing the oblique map.
%   For example, azimuthal calculations for a point in a data grid become
%   row and column operations if the data grid is transformed so that the
%   north pole of the oblique map represents the desired point on the
%   globe.  R can be a geographic raster reference object, a referencing
%   vector, or a referencing matrix.
%
%   If R is a geographic raster reference object, its RasterSize property
%   must be consistent with size(Z).
%
%   If R is a referencing vector, it must be a 1-by-3 with elements:
%
%     [cells/degree northern_latitude_limit western_longitude_limit]
%
%   If R is a referencing matrix, it must be 3-by-2 and transform raster
%   row and column indices to/from geographic coordinates according to:
% 
%                     [lon lat] = [row col 1] * R.
%
%   If R is a referencing matrix, it must define a (non-rotational,
%   non-skewed) relationship in which each column of the data grid falls
%   along a meridian and each row falls along a parallel. 
%
%   [Z,lat,lon] = NEWORIG(Z0,R,origin,'inverse') transforms
%   the regular data grid from the oblique frame to the Greenwich
%   coordinate frame.
